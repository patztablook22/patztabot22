# RP Patrik Zavoral

- `notebook` - i usually run jupyter lab here to try stuff
- `src` - code
    - `transfos` - manually implemented transformer components
        - in Torch and [Nite](https://github.com/patztablook22/nite), which is a library (essentially a wrapper)
        I am writing on top of it to \
        a) just play around with Torch \
        b) make the code more expressive and certain tasks easier
        - contains various self-attention components, FFN, encoders, decoders, architectures
        - I migth not end up using any of this at the end at all, but it's still there for me 
          as I want to really know what I am dealing with
